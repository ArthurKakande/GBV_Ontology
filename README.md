# Africa Gender-Based Violence Lexicon Ontology

Welcome to the **Africa Gender-Based Violence Lexicon Ontology** repository! This ontology provides a structured and comprehensive framework for understanding and analyzing terms, concepts, support organsiations and legal frameworks related to gender-based violence (GBV). It is designed to support researchers, policymakers, activists, and developers in building knowledge graphs, applications, and tools to address GBV (or TFGBV).

The preferred prefix for this ontology is **https://www.africagenderdata.org/** (The ontology and its knowledge graph now share this prefix with the **[Africa Gender Data Portal](https://www.africagenderdata.org/)** - a gender disaggregated data portal maintained by [The Finder's Lab](https://github.com/TheFindersLab))

## Overview

This ontology captures:
- **GBV-related terms** (e.g., "malaya", "prostitute" "slut-shaming") and their meanings.
- **Forms of violence** (e.g., psychological, verbal, physical).
- **Implications** of GBV (e.g., emotional trauma, social stigma).
- **Targeted gender(s)** (e.g., women, men).
- **Geographical context** (e.g., countries, regions, continents).
- **Legal frameworks and policies** addressing GBV (e.g., laws, enforcement agencies, effectiveness ratings).

The ontology is built using **OWL (Web Ontology Language)** and is designed to be extensible, modular, and interoperable with other knowledge graphs and semantic web tools.

## Example Queries

Here are some example SPARQL queries to get started:

1. **Find all GBV-related terms used in Nigeria:**
    ```sparql
    SELECT ?word ?meaning
    WHERE {
         ?word a :Word ;
                 :hasMeaning ?meaning ;
                 :usedInCountry :Nigeria .
    }
    ```

2. **List all legal frameworks in Africa with their effectiveness ratings:**
    ```sparql
    SELECT ?framework ?rating
    WHERE {
         ?framework a :LegalFramework ;
                        :hasEffectivenessRating ?rating ;
                        :hasLegalFramework ?country .
         ?country :locatedInContinent :Africa .
    }
    ```
